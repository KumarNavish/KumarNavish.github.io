I am a `second-year` PhD working with Prof. Aurelien Lucchi in the Optimization of Machine Learning Systems ([OMLS](https://omls.dmi.unibas.ch/en/)) Group. My current interests lie in `variational optimization`, `Bayesian inference`, and how one can understand the distributional spaces in which deep learning hyperparameters reside to come up with `well-understood` and `robust` algorithms.
