I am a second-year PhD working with [Prof. Aurelien Lucchi](https://omls.dmi.unibas.ch/en/persons/aurelien-lucchi/) in the Optimization of Machine Learning Systems ([OMLS](https://omls.dmi.unibas.ch/en/)) Group. 

> My current interests lie in `variational optimization`, `Bayesian inference`, and how one can understand the distributional spaces in which deep learning hyperparameters reside, to come up with `well-understood` and `robust` algorithms.
